# CV_detection

## Project Overview
CV_detection is a collection of Computer Vision (CV) algorithms focused on the detection of anatomical features in medical imaging, specifically hand X-ray images. This project compares traditional CV approaches with state-of-the-art deep learning models like YOLOv8.

## Features
- Custom-developed edge detection algorithms.
- Integration with YOLOv8 for object detection tasks.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HandsColds/CV_detection.git
cd CV_detection
